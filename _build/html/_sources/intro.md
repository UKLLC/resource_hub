# Introduction

>Last modified: 24 Sep 2024

Welcome to **UK LLC Resource Hub**, the home of UK LLC’s guidance and fair processing resources.


This guidance is written for longitudinal study data managers, communications staff and 
managers/principal investigators. It is designed to be relevant specifically to studies contributing to 
the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration but has wider relevance to any longitudinal study 
undertaking record linkage and data sharing.

By law, each study has to make clear its collaboration with UK LLC to its participants. In a legal 
context, these communications establish a “reasonable expectation” amongst participants as to how 
their data are used (the who, what, why, where and how), what rights the participants have and how 
they can be exercised (particularly the right to object). This does not mean the communications 
need to explain all specific details – but they do need to establish a broad understanding of what is 
happening and why.

These communications can be challenging to write as they need to be accessible to a wide range of 
the public and also include key statements which meet data owners (e.g. the NHS) and regulatory 
(e.g. Information Commissioner’s Office, Health Research Authority) requirements.

Statements which are considered to be restrictive (eg, setting a limit to the scientific purpose of the 
study, or a time limit for the study) should be carefully considered against future barriers to 
potential study activity and public benefit outcomes. Many longitudinal studies have evolved in both 
scope and duration since they were conceived and first established.

# Purpose of this Guidance & Limitations

This guidance provides a set of pointers which we recommend are followed when designing fair 
processing communications. We do not provide template text as the language used by a study 
should be appropriate for your study participants, your context and traditional mechanisms of 
communication. 

The following important limitations apply:

• We appreciate that studies may have previously communicated with their participants about
some of these key messages already, so may not need to include all of them in their 
communications.

• We cannot guarantee that the guidance provided here will result in fair processing that is 
either future proof or legally compliant. Best practice and data owner/regulator 
requirements are constantly evolving, and fair processing will need to adapt to and track 
change. Studies should seek legal guidance to test the robustness of their fair processing and 
legal basis.

• Failure to adhere to key points set out in this document may mean the study inclusion in UK 
LLC or the set-up of some or all linkages is not possible.

UK LLC is very happy to review draft materials.
We strongly recommend that the content and method of communications should be developed in 
collaboration with your PPIE representatives/groups or via other means of public co-development.

**Studies using Section 251 support**
Where a study has gained Secretary of State approval to use identifiable data without consent under 
‘Section 251’ provisions and following review by the Health Research Authority’s Confidentiality 
Advisory Group then it is considered essential (as a requirement of the HRA CAG) that the fair 
processing materials and communication methods are co-developed by study PPIE groups as 
detailed in study checklist [x]. 

If it is not possible to consult study-specific PPIE groups, please 
contact one of the UK LLC team or info@ukllc.ac.uk to discuss.
