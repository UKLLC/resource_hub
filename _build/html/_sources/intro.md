# Welcome to UK LLC Resource Hub

This guidance is written for longitudinal study data managers, communications staff and 
managers/principal investigators. It is designed to be relevant specifically to studies contributing to 
the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration but has wider relevance to any longitudinal study 
undertaking record linkage and data sharing.
By law, each study has to make clear its collaboration with UK LLC to its participants. In a legal 
context, these communications establish a “reasonable expectation” amongst participants as to how 
their data are used (the who, what, why, where and how), what rights the participants have and how 
they can be exercised (particularly the right to object). This does not mean the communications 
need to explain all specific details – but they do need to establish a broad understanding of what is 
happening and why.
These communications can be challenging to write as they need to be accessible to a wide range of 
the public and also include key statements which meet data owners (e.g. the NHS) and regulatory 
(e.g. Information Commissioner’s Office, Health Research Authority) requirements.
Statements which are considered to be restrictive (eg, setting a limit to the scientific purpose of the 
study, or a time limit for the study) should be carefully considered against future barriers to 
potential study activity and public benefit outcomes. Many longitudinal studies have evolved in both 
scope and duration since they were conceived and first established.
