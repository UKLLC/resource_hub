**The following copy is available to feature on LPS websites to explain UK LLC opening up 
for all public good research and where permissions are in place, linkages to administrative
data. The final section titled ‘How will this affect you?’ is blank for each LPS to complete 
with copy relevant to their study and to offer an opt-out.**

**Update on our partnership with UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration**

Our study is a partner in UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC) and we are letting you know 
what is changing with them, why, and how it may affect you.
UK LLC was created in 2020 as a research resource to support researchers doing priority research to 
help understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and develop new treatments. 
They have now received further funding from UK Research and Innovation, Economic and Social 
Research Council and Medical Research Council to continue to provide linked data for research. 

**What is changing?**

UK LLC is preparing to make data available, within its Trusted Research Environment, for any public 
good research. Where participant agreement is already in place, plans are underway to link study 
data with administrative data (for example, education, employment, tax and benefits records).

**What is the reason for this change?**

By linking administrative data to existing study data and expanding the resource to any public 
benefit research, UK LLC aims to help researchers answer more research questions for the public 
good.
It will enhance researchers' ability to address important issues that affect people’s health and 
wellbeing. For example, they can examine how health and mental health conditions affect care 
provision among different socio-demographic groups, identify factors that can be modified to reduce 
risks, and understand the social impact of childhood adversity on adult health inequality.

**How this will affect you?**
