Studies are subject to UK General Data Protection Regulations (UK GDPR) and Common Law Duty of 
Confidentiality. LPS should not use consent as the basis of UK GDPR compliance, but are encouraged 
to do so for Common Law. 

Both UK GDPR and Common Law require studies to be transparent in their operations and provide 
clear information to participants describing data use. In England, studies can apply to HRA CAG for 
s.215 Support which allows Common Law duties to be set aside, but this will need to be done on the 
basis of providing fair processing materials and a route to opt out.

The phrasing of consent statements and fair processing materials should be made carefully, taking 
into account insights from methodological investigations into consenting behaviours and also to 
avoid imposing unnecessary limitations on data use. Consent phrasing should make clear the 
understanding and agreement on the high-level principles involved, whereas information materials 
can provide detail and exemplar illustrations.

Expectations of good practice in consent will change over time. Therefore, any development process 
should start with evaluating guidance and academic literature and then consulting with domain 
experts, data owners and study participants. The co-design of materials with participants is a critical 
element of the process.

There is a significant amount of supporting documentation you will need to have in place, some of 
which you may already have in place, although it may need to be updated to reflect the new sources 
of data. This will include a study protocol [HRA protocol](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/research-planning/protocol/), a study privacy policy [ALSPAC privacy notice](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/participants/privacy/), a data asset register and a data flow diagram.

UK LLC is working with NHS England‚Äôs Advisory Group for Data (SGD) to formalise a consistent review 
process this will be finalised in the coming weeks and months. The idea is that NHS England‚Äôs team will review and approve applications, escalating incidences where there is no precedent to either 
AGD or NHS England‚Äôs Caldicott Guardian.

The HRA provides quite detailed guidance for the IRAS online tool
[HRA and HCRW Approval](https://www.myresearchproject.org.uk/help/hlphraapproval.aspx) which is an integrated 
application system in that it allows for applying to both REC and CAG from the same form.

You will need to register for the NHS DSPT [DSP Toolkit](https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/). It is recommended that 
you contact your host organisation‚Äôs Information Governance department in the first instance 
because it is highly likely they will have a NHS-DSPT already and you will probably find that you share 
a significant proportion of their facilities, particularly IT, cyber-security and infrastructure.

The application to NHS-D for the health records is done via their DARS and comprehensive guidance 
is available at Data Access Request Service (DARS) - NHS Digital. Fortunately, you will find that you 
should be able to re-use text from the earlier stages in the DARS. 

Other sources of advice include Medical Research Council‚Äôs regulatory support centre 
[MRC Regulatory Support Centre](https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/facilities-and-resources/find-an-mrc-facility-or-resource/mrc-regulatory-support-centre/) and [Identifiability, anonymisation and pseudonymisation](https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MRC-291121-GDPR-Identifiability-Anonymisation-Pseudonymisation.pdf) and [Consent and Participant Information Guidance](http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/consent/).

Other, more general, sources include [Understanding patient data](https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/) which provides 
guidance and examples of communication materials. This site is closely aligned to the NHS Data 
Guardian, and is therefore considered gold standard by NHS Digital.

# ‚úèÔ∏è Consent
<div style="background-color: #e2ed80; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
UK Longitudinal Population Studies are often called the 'consented studies', but the role of consent 
in these studies is complicated. All study participants are volunteers who have chosen to join the 
study, and all have the right to withdraw whenever they want. In this sense all participation is 
'consented' in that it is based on an active and informed relationship. Studies may also seek consent 
for specific aspects of activity in the study, such as using genetic information or linking to health 
records. However, studies can run over decades, it is hard to keep consent up to date and reflecting 
changes in technology and best practice - such as UK LLC. This means for studies 'consent' is difficult 
to manage.‚ÄØ

From a legal perspective, consent is:‚ÄØ

* NOT the basis by which studies comply with GDPR and Data Protection Law - scientific research is 
a permitted purpose in its own right; and‚ÄØ
* is OFTEN the basis by which the common law duty of confidentiality is met. In common law, 
information given under an expectation of privacy (for example, information from a patient to 
their doctor), should stay private unless permission to share it is in place.

However, seeking consent is often not possible, or is only likely to get responses from people who 
tend to be healthier and in better social and economic circumstances. Seeking consent often biases 
research or excludes some harder to reach communities such as children in the care system, or 
those in temporary accommodation.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ

Sometimes seeking consent is not possible, if the person has died or no longer has capacity to make 
a choice (for example, someone with Dementia). For this reason, there are laws which make it 
possible to use data without breaching common law. These laws were used during the pandemic, 
but also exist in general to help ensure research is fair and inclusive. For the use of NHS data in 
England, this law is often called Section 251.

# üìí Legal basis
<div style="background-color: #f49985; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
Most LPS process identifiable data given that they hold participant contact databases and administer 
processes which require the use of identifiers (mailing information and data collection exercises, 
conducting fieldwork or study assessments, linking to participant records). It is therefore the case 
that studies manage Personal Data (broadly, the legal term for identifiable data within the Data 
Protection Act) and therefore UK General Data Protection Regulations (UK GDPR) and Common Law 
Duty of Confidentiality apply.

Most studies pseudonymise their data to remove identifiers and replace these with a ID number. It is 
still the case that where these can be linked back to the identifiers pseudonymous data is still 
Personal Data.

UK GDPR makes a distinction between data and sensitive data: all health data are considered 
sensitive as are other classes of information including many demographic characteristics. The 
processing of these will need additional safeguards.

**UK General Data Protection Regulations**
There is clear guidance and a broad consensus that studies should not be using consent as a means 
to process participant Personal Data. Rather, studies should make use of alternative legal basis 
within the regulations:
1) performance of a task carried out in the public interest (Article 6(1)(e) in the GDPR).
and, where sensitive personal information is involved:
2) scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes (Article 9(2)(j) in 
accordance with Article 89(1)).

UK GDPR sets out a series of rights for individuals. For research, there are derogations in place which 
mean that not all UK GDPR rights need to be applied. Studies will need to manage the expectations 
of participants in this area as this can conflict with widely held beliefs about rights. Studies must 
be transparent with participants about how the study uses participant data and it is expected that 
studies should offer a means to object and withdraw (although this is grounded in research ethics 
and the need to build/maintain trust and acceptability rather than being required through UK 
GDPR).

# üìÇ Common Law Duty of Confidentiality
<div style="background-color: #e2ed80; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
Common Law (which has the same status as statute law) applies when a person provides a study 
with information in the expectation that it will be treated in confidence. For a study to process 
Personal Data it is therefore the case that they must make ‚Äòbest endeavours‚Äô to set a ‚Äòreasonable 
expectation‚Äô about this processing. This will apply to fundamental study activities including onward 
sharing, the nature of the research programme and record linkage.

Reasonable expectations are set through providing ‚Äòfair processing‚Äô (a UK GDPR term) which means 
that participants must have a clear overview of study activities which includes awareness of key 
concepts rather than fine details. Fair processing should be implemented through a variety of means 
and key messages reinforced over time.

To demonstrate compliance with Common Law studies must either collect consent, implement a 
mechanism to lift Common Law requirements (such as ‚ÄòSection 251‚Äô support to use NHS records 
without consent), establish a reasonable
