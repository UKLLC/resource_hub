Communications should be made through an ‘active campaign’ i.e. sent by Longitudinal Population 
Studies (LPS) to all participants, this could be through newsletters or letters sent either electronically 
or mailed out to all participants which must provide a means to object (studies may choose to seek 
specific opt-in consent). Social media can provide updates and is particularly effective in alerting 
participants to change and promoting new research use and outcomes.
Studies should consider Equality issues when determining whether to use electronic and postal 
mechanisms and while an electronic-only approach may be suitable in some studies, for most a 
choice of physical media (ie, postal materials) and electronic media should be offered. Reasonable 
adjustments should be made to accommodate participants specific needs (eg, large print media or 
audio versions).

Our PPIE feedback suggests a newsletter/letter/email sent directly to participants is considered 
preferable to other routes of communication which may be considered ‘optional’ to read – yet, it is 
also acknowledged that each study has a distinct way of communicating with participants (eg, 
Christmas card updates) which may form the most appropriate mechanism at a study level.
The Information Commissioner’s Office recommends a **layered approach** to providing information 
for example with a high-level summary (e.g. cover letter, infographic) then a detailed graphical type 
leaflet and signposting or providing a source of more detail e.g. privacy notice/web source for 
participants who want to understand the detail. Key messages should be reinforced over time 
preferably through annual active communications.

**Existing information should be up to date** e.g. privacy notices, and participant information sheets to 
reflect changes in practice. New stories should be added to existing media e.g. website updates, 
social media, newsflashes or blogs should be updated where possible to alert participants to changes 
and to keep ‘consent’ a live item.

UK GDPR requires studies to issue ‘Privacy Notices’ providing fair processing. It should be stressed 
that while all materials and other communications with participants constitute fair processing, there 
is a separate need to provide a ‘Privacy Notice’. The ICO has produced guidance describing what 
information should be included. The Privacy Notice provides an opportunity to provide very detailed 
information for those participants (and other stakeholders) who wish to understand this level of 
detail.
