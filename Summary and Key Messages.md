This guidance is intended as a guide based on a synthesis of good practice from the study’s fair 
processing and insights from negotiations with data owners and regulators. We thank all the study 
teams, data owners and regulators for all their contributions to this.
We fully acknowledge the existing body of good practice and expertise in the participant's
community within studies – these materials are based on the community’s collective efforts and 
expertise.

**Purpose:** Studies must take all reasonable and pragmatic measures to ensure participants have a 
reasonable expectation of how their data are used - the ‘no surprises’ principle. For this reason, 
studies must provide ‘fair processing’ information updates to participants regarding record linkage, 
the sharing of data with research users, and the role of UK LLC in these processes.

Fair Processing must make clear that:

• Study data are used for a range of research purposes (which could extend from including any 
public benefit research to being limited to a specific hypothesis or theme of research)

• A national Trusted Research Environment(s) is used to enable this linkage in a secure manner 
(named UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration) along with the NHS and National Statistics 
Agencies whose role it is to provide access to participants’ records for research purposes

• Your study shares de-identified data with approved research users who do not work directly 
for the study or your institution

• That participants have the right to opt-out and to signpost the mechanism to do this.

**Method:** The fair processing must be actively communicated to participants using direct methods 
such as posts or emails, not just website updates. Regular updates – eg, newsletter items – are 
needed to remind participants about how their data are used and their right to object.

**Language:** You should use the language that is suited to your study and your sample. There is no 
fixed wording (we provide illustrative examples below). We recommend studies adopt the 
Information Commissioner's Office recommendation for ‘layered’ information materials, where an 
initial message is designed to provide an overview, and which is very accessible. This can be 
supported by ‘layers’ of increasing detail (such as a booklet, infographic, animation and then 
detailed online resources such as a privacy notice or FAQ). Materials are provided in this guide to support 
these more detailed descriptions.

**Public/Participant Involvement:** UK LLC strongly recommends the involvement of participants and 
public contributors in understanding what is needed to help ensure there are ‘no surprises’ around 
data use and to co-develop fair processing materials.
Studies using Section 251 support must involve participants and/or the public – including gaining 
feedback on the acceptability of the collaboration with UK LLC, whether existing fair processing is 
sufficient and co-developing new fair processing – to gain/maintain CAG approval.
